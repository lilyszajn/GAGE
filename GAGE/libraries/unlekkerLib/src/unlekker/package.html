<h1>unlekkerLib</h1>
<p>unlekkerLib is a collection of tools and code snippets I use frequently, 
and which I've just barely cleaned up enough for other people to use. Instead of releasing them piece by piece, I've decided to bundle them together in a package hierarchy. Caveat emptor:
There's not much documentation but I do provide the source code.</p>
<p>This is v.0001, the very first release. Updates will appear on <a href="http://workshop.evolutionzone.com/unlekkerLib/">http://workshop.evolutionzone.com/unlekkerLib/</a>.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Copy the &quot;unlekker&quot; folder from the &quot;Install in Processing&quot; folder into the &quot;libraries&quot; subfolder of your Processing application. The library should now appear as a choice in &quot;Import library&quot; next time you start Processing.</p>
<h3>[070924] unlekkerLib-0001:</h3>
