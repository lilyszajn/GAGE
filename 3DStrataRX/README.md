1. <a href = "http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.253169000?WT.mc_id=mscom_xbox_PDP_253169000">Get yourself a Kinect</a> and a copy of <a href = "http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020684.do">Making Things See</a>
<br>
2. <a href = "https://www.processing.org/download/">Install Processing</a>. Processing is a programming language, development environment, and online community for creating cool applications. 
<br>
3.  <a href = "https://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/downloads/detail?name=SimpleOpenNI-1.96.zip">Install Simple OpenNI</a>. This is the library that allows us to communicate the data from OpenNI to Processing. To do this, install and unzip the file linked above. Once unzipped, drag the folder to your libraries folder in Processing. Once it is there, restart Processing. *This zip file INCLUDES OpenNI which is the driver that reads the depth data from the Kinect as well as the middleware with the algorithms that translate the skeleton data for body tracking.
